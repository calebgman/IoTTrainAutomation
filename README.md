# IoTTrainAutomation

## Overview
Welcome to the IoTTrainAutomation Senior Project from Nolan G. Josh B. & Caleb G. This project was designed with efficiency 
and safety as our top priority. This design operates using a connected network of nodes ( a gateway node, a locomotive node, 
a level crossing node, & finally a switch node) that communicate with one another via LoRa communiation. This system allows 
for real-time data transfer and communication between trains, improving safety and reducing the risk of accidents. 
Additionally, the use of LoRa communication ensures that there is a reliable and secure connection between the trains, making 
it a safer means of travel, as well as moving large shipments. With our system, routing is also optimized to ensure the most
efficient and effective route is taken, reducing travel time and improving overall productivity. Our use of IoT technology 
also enabled us to have real time tracking and monitoring of trains, allowing for quick response to any issue or accident
that may arise during travel time. Our system features speed monitoring as well as location to ensure that all train 
operations are secure and reliable.
